# Basil

Basil is a Pure Date patch comprising a dual VCO intended for use on mxmxmx's Terminal Tedium Eurorack module. The VCOs can be shaped from sine to sawtooth, cross-modulated, mixed together, ring-modulated, and run through a wavefolder. VCO 2 can be used to reset the phase (sync) VCO 1, and both VCOs can be synced to outside audio sources. 

This algorithm is based on the phase-modulation mode in [Noise Engineering's Loquelic Iteritas](https://www.noiseengineering.us/loquelic-iteritas/) Eurorack module. 

This is not a clean algorithm. There is no oversampling, so things can get dirty and nasty quickly. But that's the point.
