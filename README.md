This is a collection of Pure Data patches intended for use on [mxmxmx's Terminal Tedium](https://github.com/mxmxmx/terminal_tedium) Eurorack module. 

## Basil

Basil is a dual VCO with controls for waveshaping and intermodulation. It's good at creating harsh, metallic, digital textures. 

## Pierre

Pierre is an experimental tape machine simulator based on the Make Noise Phonogene Eurorack module. This patch should be considered unstable and a work-in-progress.
